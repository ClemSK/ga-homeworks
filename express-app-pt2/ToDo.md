- update albums/movies Schema to include tracks/actors
- user.js: creating a user schema, password
- create user controller + install jwt (jsonwebtoken)
- create secret in env file
- middleware + secure routes: using a bearer token to get info from api
- add secure routes to the router
- update the albums and tracks controllers
- add secure routes to the router again after testing
- test the api controller
- add comments to all the new code sections

why am I not getting a token? need to login to get the token and then paste it in the authorization section with 'Bearer Token'.

now get all tracks for an album and all albums for a track
